class 1 = heart disease, 0 = Normal


This dataset includes 272 duplicate records, notably all data from statlog is in the original dataset. Also all locations where data was previously missing look like they were simply set to 0. User beware.

Check outliers first, if they're too many, use the median value to replace the zeros, otherwise use the mean value.
